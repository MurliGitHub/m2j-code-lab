## 📌 Overview
**M2J Code Lab** is a personal project for learning, practicing, and experimenting with:
- Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- System Design & Architecture
- Backend development experiments (Java, Spring Boot, Micronaut)
- AI/ML experiments (future expansion)

This repo serves as a **practice playground** and reference for problem-solving patterns, system design case studies, and coding experiments.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MurliGitHub/m2j-code-lab.git
cd m2j-code-lab
```

2. **For Java Projects**
- Build using Maven:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
- Run Spring Boot applications:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

3. **For Algorithm Practice**
- Navigate to the folder of your choice, e.g., `algorithms/arrays/`
- Open or run individual solution files in your IDE.

4. **For System Design / Notes**
- Check `designs/` for case studies, diagrams, and architecture notes.
- Use it as reference for mock interviews or real-world problem design.
